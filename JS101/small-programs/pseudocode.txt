# A function that return the sum of two numbers

Start 
  Set:
    - Number 1
    - Number 2
    - opertation

  Get:
    - 1st number from user
    - 2nd number from user
    - opertation from user

  Print:
    - Number 1 + opertation + Number 2
End


#  a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together 

Start
  Set:
    - Combined strings

  Get:
    - Array of strings

  While:
    - index < array
      - Combined variable + array[index]

  Read:
    -return Combined variable
  
  Print:
    -Combined variable
End

# a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance: 

Start
  Set:
    - New Array

  Get:
    - Array from user

  While:
    - index = 0 < array
      - increment index + 2 (So index will always skip over the next index)

  Read:
    -return New Array

  Print:
    - New Array
End

# a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return null. 

Start
  Set:
    - Occurrence
  
  Get:
    - Need string from user
      - Then break the string back into an array of each character
    - Which value they want to check for 

  While:
    - Iterate over each character
      If: Character matches the value that was wanted to check for
        - Occurrence += 1

      Else: Continue interating through the string

  If:
    - If Occurrence === 3
      - Return the location of the index the 3rd occurance happened
    - Else 
      - Return null
End

# a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance: 

Start
  Set:
    - New Array to length of both arrays given

  Get:
    - Number of Array 1
    - Number of Array 2
  
  While:
    -Iterate over Array 1
      - push current value of the index to every odd position of the new array
    -Iterate over Array 2
      - push current value of the index to every even position of the new array

  Read:
    - New array

  Print:
    - New array
End
